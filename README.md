## Description


### User_Story

- You are an investor in cryptocurrency.
- You need a web host where you can easily track my stocks investment.
- With the web host, you will be able to store your investment info, and keep updated with latest news.


### Features

**What needs are we meeting?**
- From the beginning, the system of how we buy and sell goods has always been changing.
With the advent of technological advancements, our society is changing rapidly. This change could and probably will include our world's current currency system.
With the looming changes, the investors have shown growing interest in the future of the currency system.
Under the changing global economic circumstances, we see a needs gap of many potential investors. We want to meet their needs, so that they may:
1. Be able to search the current stocks prices of User's choice of cryptocurrency.
2. Keep up to date with the latest news of the User's choices.
3. Be able to store the User's choices when he logs into the web host.

**What would be the foreseeable consequence of the needs if unmet?**
- If we do not meet the aforementioned needs of the investors, then:
1. The investors will not be supplied with the broad array of options, so they may make an informed and confident decision in engaging in cryptocurrency investment.
2. We will not be able to inspire others to push our global interactions to the next step in history.

**What were our goals?**
- Wire up two server-side APIs.
- Construct a responsive UI.
- Create an interactive UI(i.e. respond to User's input).
- Use the client-side storage to store User's data object.
- Use a CSS framework: Bootstrap, but do NOT use JS popup dialogue boxes (i.e. JS alerts, confirms, or prompts).
- Exercise best coding practice.
- Deploy a working application to GitHub Repo.
